The soft, neutral tones allow light to flow freely, making rooms feel open and airy, while natural wood adds depth, warmth, and an organic touch. As more people seek spaces that are both inviting and timeless, beige, white, and wood tones have surged in popularity, establishing themselves as the go-to choice for those who want a harmonious, uncluttered home.</p>

            <h3>Average Rent for Condos in Montreal</h3>
            <ul class="avg1">
                <li>
                    <p><b>Around $5,500 - $10,000</b> - In 2024, luxury condos are still impacted by high demand, especially in urban centers and high-demand areas. Prices have remained elevated due to inflation, supply chain disruptions affecting construction, and an ongoing shortage of available high-end properties. Technology integration within units, such as smart home systems and energy-efficient features, also adds to the cost. Additionally, luxury amenities such as concierge services, pools, gyms, and communal spaces remain in high demand, driving up rent prices.</p>
                </li>

            <ul class="avg2">
                <li>
                    <p><b>Around $4,500 - $8,500</b> - The pandemic's impact on the economy started to stabilize in 2022, but the effects were still felt. Luxury condos, particularly those in prime locations, saw rent prices climb back as people returned to cities. Remote work trends influenced the types of amenities in demand, with more space for home offices, which pushed up rental costs. The cost of living was also rising due to inflation, and construction material prices were still high, leading to fewer new luxury condos on the market.</p>

                <li>
                    <p><b>Around $3,800 - $6,500</b> - In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic drastically altered the real estate market. There was a brief dip in luxury condo rent prices as demand dropped due to economic uncertainty and people moving away from dense urban areas. However, premium properties in desirable locations, with amenities like home offices and outdoor spaces, still commanded high rents. Many luxury buildings adjusted their services and features to cater to new trends like remote working, virtual amenities, and socially distanced communal areas, but rent still reflected a decline in overall demand.</p>

                <li>
                    <p><b>Around $3,800 - $6,500</b> - In 2018, the luxury condo market was seeing relatively stable growth with prices being high in major metropolitan areas. Demand was strong, driven by an influx of international buyers and renters seeking upscale, modern amenities and prime locations. Features like rooftop terraces, high-end kitchens, fitness centers, and concierge services were standard. The market was competitive, with luxury properties providing value for those seeking high-end living.</p>
